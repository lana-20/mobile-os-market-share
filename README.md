# Mobile OS Market Share - A Decade Ago

The challenges which mobile developers and QAs had to face [10 years ago](https://lana-20.github.io/mobile-os-market-share/).

If I travel back in time, for example, to a period of October-December 2012, the mobile market looked quite different:

There were a lot of OSs to deal with, in addition to Android and iOS:
- Series 40 used to be on Nokia phones, Nokia produced it itself. Then Nokia switched to Symbian which was more advanced at that moment.
- Samsung used to have their own OS.
- Blackberry OS
- Wimdows phones

Iâ€™d have to hire many different developers in case I wanted to develop a native application. This would cost me lots of time and money.
